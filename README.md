  Hi! My name is Yeltsin,programmer with a strong interest in backend development leveraging Python. I have dedicated time to acquiring proficiency in Python and its application in data manipulation, including XML and JSON parsing and generation. My exploration extends to the Django framework, where I am currently learning to architect the foundational layers of web applications. While my formal professional experience in development is nascent, I maintain a dedicated commitment to continuous learning through personal projects. I am actively seeking opportunities for collaboration to apply my knowledge of Python and Django, with the objective of professional growth as a backend developer and to contribute to innovative technological endeavors. I value collaborative environments and am eager to embark on my initial professional steps within the field.
